# Can you change the values inside a list which is contained in set S?
s = {8, 7, 12, "Harry", [1,2]}
 
# What will be the output of the above code?
# The code will raise a TypeError because lists are mutable and cannot be added to a set.
# The output will be an error message indicating that lists are unhashable types.
